This website was created under the guidance of Angela Yu and her Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy. 

This mini project took us through using node modules, how to navigate MongoDB databases, collections and using the items in the collections and rendering them on the website using EmbeddedJS (EJS). 

The back-end of the app is Express.JS, the database is MongoDB and front-end is EJS with Bootstrap. The contact form is done via MailChimp email as a proof of concept.

Website allows the posts to display under two different views. As a regular list, or in form of cards. More below on the attached photos.

The code can be freely reused and improved. I am open to suggestions if anyone has anything to add when it comes to DRY code.
